            <p>The next Battlefield 2042 update will be released on September 10. The upcoming Battlefield 2042 update will introduce new content and minor changes to the game, continuing DICE’s support after the game no longer has seasonal content.</p>
            <p>Originally released in 2021, Battlefield 2042 is the latest entry in the Battlefield franchise. At launch, Battlefield 2042 received negative and mixed reviews, with both critics and gamers disappointed with several technical issues, and some 
                calling it a “step back” when compared to its predecessors. Despite failing to meet both financial and critical success at release, EA and DICE continued to support Battlefield 2042, and the game has greatly improved since then. In the last three years,
                 Battlefield 2042 had seven seasons, ending with “Turning Point,” which was released on March 19, 2024.</p>

            <p>
                Battlefield 2042 is a 2021 first-person shooter, developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. 
                The twelfth main installment in the Battlefield series, it was released on November 19, 2021, for PlayStation 4,
                 PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. 2042 is the first installment since 2006's Battlefield 2142 to solely 
                 be a multiplayer video game, without a single-player campaign. It is also the first installment to feature support for 
                 cross-platform play.
            </p>

            <p>The game received mixed reviews from critics and a more negative reception from players for its technical issues, lack of features, 
                and certain changes to the gameplay. The game failed to meet the sales expectations of Electronic Arts. A new Battlefield installment, 
                under the head of Motive Studio, is in development.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed final shape but once completed, I felt little drawing me back to the game.</p>
            <p> I am also fed up of all the best stuff being stuck behind PvP. Trials is infuriating if your not a total sweat and I've always spent as little time as possible in PvP.</p>
            <p>The rest of the game has followed a similar formula for some time now meaning if your a long term player, there is little origional content being added</p>
