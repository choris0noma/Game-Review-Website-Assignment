                <li>The highly anticipated STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has gone gold, confirming its release after a lengthy development time.</li>

        <article class = "game-text1">
            <p>Fans patiently waiting for the release of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl won't have to wait much longer, as the game has finally gone gold, signaling the final stretch before its release. The November 20, 2024 release date of STALKER 2 will mark the end of a lengthy development saga for the game, marked by multiple delays.</p>
            <p>The original STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl game from 2007 took inspiration from classic Soviet-era science fiction stories, setting the game in the "Exclusion Zone" surrounding the Ukrainian city of Chernobyl, which was depopulated by a nuclear reactor meltdown in 1986. Featuring realistic gunplay, challenging survival mechanics,
                 and a tense, apocalyptic atmosphere, STALKER became a beloved classic among shooter fans, and arguably one of the earliest modern open-world survival games. Unfortunately for fans eager to see a sequel, STALKER 2's development path has been a long, bumpy road, marked by delays, the dissolution and reformation of developer GSC Game 
                 World itself, and the outbreak of war between Ukraine and Russia. The saga was even the subject of a documentary film called War Game: The Making of STALKER 2, focused on the series' history and the effects of the war on staff at GSC Game World.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed final shape but once completed, I felt little drawing me back to the game.</p>
            <p> I am also fed up of all the best stuff being stuck behind PvP. Trials is infuriating if your not a total sweat and I've always spent as little time as possible in PvP.</p>
            <p>The rest of the game has followed a similar formula for some time now meaning if your a long term player, there is little origional content being added</p>
